# MyLittleFish
*MyLittleFish* is a game very fun created in Android studio with Java. You can easily clone this repository and change the fish to whatever you want by just changing the fish's image. The size of the image is 64x64 so your image shouldn't be too big. If you opted for another image I would recommend you to keep the same name. Either way you'd have to change all the variables name.
NB: Your image should be in the drawable folder.
